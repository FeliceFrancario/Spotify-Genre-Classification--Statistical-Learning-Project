The objective of this project was to analyze the diverse landscape
 of music genres and develop a classification model capable of
 predicting the genre of a song based on its audio features. The
 following models were applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression
 with feature selection using AIC/BIC criterion, or regularization with
 Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net; KNN;Random Forest; Gradient Boosting. Here you can find the code and the project report.
